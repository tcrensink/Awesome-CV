% The aim of this document is:
% - to convince an employer that you can solve their problems
% - to get an employer to look at your resume
% - (possibly) to give context about you as a human, as that appears nowhere else

% Orient the cover letter to your audience.  Specifically:
% - They don't care about nonlocal potentials.  
% - They don't know what the Schrodinger Equation is.  
% - They don't know or care what a hypersphere.
% - They *will* care about your analytic and modeling experience, if you contextualize it correctly.

\textbf{To hiring managers at KLA-Tencor,}
\bigskip
%\bigskip
\bigskip
 
\textbf{Having recently completed a Ph.D. in theoretical physics}, I have spent the past several months pivoting towards the field of machine learning/deep learning.   Coupled with my mathematical and computational background, I am confident that I will be a strong value-add to quantitative, predictive modeling in implementing modern deep learning algorithms.  Some of the experiences and skillset that I could bring to your team include:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item a deep knowledge of applied mathematics (multivariate calculus, linear algebra, vector spaces, etc), and signal processing and transform methods as applied to time-series and image data
\item significant experience developing mathematical models to characterize physical systems and details of numerical implementations
\item strong computer science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, object oriented programming, and code management/collaboration tools (git, github)
\item experience with GPU accelerated libraries (Tensorflow/Keras) and high performance computing environments (batch submissions to remote NERSC supercomputers)
 \item an increasing knowledge of machine learning/deep learning models and algorithms through independent study and projects
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\textbf{I'm looking for a team that is passionate and highly motivated} to stay current with the latest developments in machine learning and deep learning, and apply state of the art models to problems that could not be solved otherwise.

\textbf{Outside of my professional life} I try to stay active in a number of interests.  Some of these include: musical composition/creation, keeping up my French, triathlon training, and various creative projects that leverage my technical background.  Please have a look at the links at my resume and the links at the top (portfolio, github, linkedin) to see more.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you!

\bigskip
\textbf{Sincerely,}

\textbf{Thomas Rensink}
